CORE BIG DATA CONCEPTS 
------------------------------
Big data - charecterised by 3vs - volume, velocity and variety 

Data warehouse - data is structured and rigid , processed, 
Data lake - raw or unstructured data, more flexible, ready to analyse 

OLTP - online transactional processing - high volume , short , high integrity needed
OLAP - online analytical processing - low volume, produce reports and analytics 

OLTP modify the database ,  OLAP query the database 

sql and no sql 
sql -tabular format 
nosql - stores other than sql 
includes - key-value stores, json-document-stores 

Batch vs streaming
----------------------
Batch - data gathered within a defined window period , large volumes of data 
Streaming - Continuous collection of data. Near real time analytics is possible. Windows and micro batches also possible 

Data processing pipelines 
----------------------
pipelines are system that allows data to go from a to b to c to d in most optimized manner 
  
  stages of data pipelines 
  ingestion >> storage >> processing >> visualisation 

  ingestion - ingesting data from different source to data warehouse or data lake
